    <h3> ...introduction python...  </h3>

 <b>   Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

    web development (server-side),
    software development,
    mathematics,
    system scripting.

What can Python do?

    Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
    Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
    Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
    Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
    Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

 <b><h3>Syntax Python </h3></b>
 <p>
    
  <b>  Execute Python Syntax

    As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
    <br>
    >>> print("Hello, World!")
    <br>
        Hello, World!
        </p>
    </b>

    <br>
    <b><h3> COMMENT IN PYTHON </h3></b>
    <p><b>Comments can be used to explain Python code.

        Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
        
        Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
        Creating a Comment
        
        Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
        Example
        Get your own Python Server
        #This is a comment
        print("Hello, World!") </b>
        </p>

       <h3>variable in python </h3>

       <b>ex: of variable and creating</b>
       <br>
       <b> a=10
        <br>
           b=20
        <br>
           print(a,b)
        <br>
           a is a variable to allocate the memory to the ram in a particular address to store the number of 10 in ram .

       <h3> ...Data Type...  </h3>
       <b>Built-in Data Types

        In programming, data type is an important concept.
        
        Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
        <br>
        Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
        <br>
        Text Type: 	str
        <br>
        Numeric Types: 	int, float, complex
        <br>
        Sequence Types: 	list, tuple, range
        <br>
        Mapping Type: 	dict
        <br>
        Set Types: 	set, frozenset
        <br>
        Boolean Type: 	bool
        <br>
        Binary Types: 	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
        None Type: 	NoneType
        </b>
        <br>
        <h3> ... Operator ... </h3>
        <b>
            Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

            In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
            Example
            Get your own Python Server
            print(10 + 5)
            
            Python divides the operators in the following groups:
            
                Arithmetic operators
                <br>
                Assignment operators
                <br>
                Comparison operators
                <br>
                Logical operators
                <br>
                Identity operators
                <br>
                Membership operators
                <br>
                Bitwise operators
            

        </b>
        <br>
        <h3>... String in python ...</h3>
        <b>
            Strings

            Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
            <br>
            'hello' is the same as "hello".
            <br>
            You can display a string literal with the print() function:
            <br>
            Example
            <br>
            Get your own Python Server
            <br>
            print("Hello")
            <br>
            print('Hello')
            

        </b>
        <br>
        <h3> List in Python </h3>
        <b>
            Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
               <br>
            Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
             <br>
            Lists are created using square brackets:
            <br>
            Example
            <br>
            Get your own Python Server
            <br>
            Create a List:
            <br>
            thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            <br>
            print(thislist)
            


        </b>
    <br>
        <h3>... Tuple in python ..</h3>
        <b>

            Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
<br>
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
<br>
Tuples are written with round brackets.
<br>
Example
Get your own Python Server

Create a Tuple:
<br>
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
<br>
print(thistuple)
<br>

        </b>
 <br>
 <h3> Dictionary </h3>
 <b>
    
      A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
       <br>  
      As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
       <br>
      Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
      <br>
      Example
      <br>
      Get your own Python Server
      <br>
      Create and print a dictionary:
      <br>
      thisdict =
      <br>	
        "brand": "Ford",
        <br>
        "model": "Mustang",
        <br>
        "year": 1964
       <br>
      print(thisdict)
